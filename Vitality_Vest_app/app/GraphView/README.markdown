* Line Chart, Bar Chart, Points
* Combination of different graph types
* Scrolling vertical and horizontal

* Scaling / Zooming vertical and horizontal
. With two-fingers touch scale gesture (Multi-touch), the viewport can be changed.
* Realtime Graph (Live change of data)
* Second scale axis
* Draw multiple series of data
. Let the diagram show more that one series in a graph. You can set a color and a description for every series.
* Show legend
. A legend can be displayed inline the chart. You can set the width and the vertical align (top, middle, bottom).

        android:id="@+id/graph" />
```

3) Add some data:
```
GraphView graph = (GraphView) findViewById(R.id.graph);
LineGraphSeries<DataPoint> series = new LineGraphSeries<DataPoint>(new DataPoint[] {
          new DataPoint(0, 1),
          new DataPoint(1, 5),
          new DataPoint(2, 3),
          new DataPoint(3, 2),
          new DataPoint(4, 6)
});
graph.addSeries(series);
